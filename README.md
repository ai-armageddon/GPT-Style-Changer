# GPT-Style-Changer

GPT-Style-Changer is a Chrome extension that allows users to customize the look and feel of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ai-armageddon/GPT-Style-Changer.git`


2. Open Chrome and go to the following URL:

`chrome://extensions/`


3. Turn on **Developer mode** in the top right corner of the page.

4. Click on the **Load unpacked** button in the top left corner of the page.

5. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the **GPT-Style-Changer** folder.

6. The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

## Usage
 
Once installed, the extension will automatically run on the ChatGPT website

**Will be adding menu with preset themes and theme builder option in upcoming version.**

## Editing Styles

Edit styles in styles.scss file. You'll need a compiler for SCSS which will output a styles.css file. For dev purposes, the Live Sass Compiler extension for VS Code was used and it's recommended you use the same.

If you don't want to use a SASS compiler, you can just edit the plain CSS styles in the styles.css file.

Once styles are updated, make sure to update your package in Chrome.
